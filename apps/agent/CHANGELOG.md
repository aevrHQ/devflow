## Version Format

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new features (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH** version for bug fixes (backwards compatible)

## Release Process

### Creating a Release

Use npm scripts for semantic versioning:

```bash
# For bug fixes (PATCH: 0.2.0 → 0.2.1)
npm run release:patch

# For new features (MINOR: 0.2.0 → 0.3.0)
npm run release:minor

# For breaking changes (MAJOR: 0.2.0 → 1.0.0)
npm run release:major

# Auto-detect based on commits
npm run release
```

### What Happens

Each release command will:
1. ✅ Analyze conventional commits since last tag
2. ✅ Update version in package.json
3. ✅ Generate/append to CHANGELOG.md
4. ✅ Create git commit with tag
5. ✅ Ready to push and publish

### Commit Convention

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new feature
fix: fix a bug
perf: improve performance
docs: update documentation
refactor: refactor code
test: add tests
chore: maintenance tasks
```

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new workflow type"
git commit -m "fix: correct agent polling interval"
git commit -m "docs: update API reference"
```

## Publishing

After creating a release:

```bash
# Push changes and tags
git push origin main --follow-tags

# Publish to npm (in apps/agent)
npm publish --access public
```
